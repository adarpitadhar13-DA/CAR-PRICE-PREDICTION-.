üöó Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
üìù Introduction
Welcome to the Car Price Prediction repository!

This project focuses on building a robust Machine Learning model to accurately predict the selling price of used cars based on various features. This model can be a valuable tool for both sellers looking to price their vehicles competitively and buyers seeking fair market value.

The process involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), comprehensive Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering, training multiple Regression Models, and finally, selecting and deploying the best-performing model.

‚ú® Features
Data Analysis: In-depth EDA to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.

Model Training: Implementation and comparison of various regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Model Evaluation: Performance assessment using key regression metrics like R 
2
  Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Best Model: Selection of the optimal model based on evaluation metrics.

Deployment (Optional): A simple web application built with [Flask/Streamlit/etc.] to demonstrate real-time predictions.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Language: Python

Data Analysis & Manipulation: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Machine Learning: scikit-learn

Advanced Models (if used): xgboost, lightgbm

Web Framework (if deployed): Flask / Streamlit
